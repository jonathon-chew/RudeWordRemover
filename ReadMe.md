# Rude Word Remover

This is a template to be adapted for any one to use, to search through a file (in this case a .txt file) and remove a list of rude words.

The list of rude words is listed above in a dictionary.

It writes back to the file identically, but with the rude words removed.


(Currently it's got it's test function in place, remove the create file and write to begin with in order for this to be run as a function)
